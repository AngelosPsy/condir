condir allows the easy analysis of conditioning data, within both a frequentists and Bayesian framework. By the term 'conditioning data' we refer to any type of collected responses from experiments that include the associations between different stimuli (e.g., a picture and an aversive sound).

Installation information as well as relevant examples are provided in the vignette named 'condir-examples' as well as in Krypotos, A. M., Klugkist, I., & Engelhard, I. M. (2017). Bayesian hypothesis testing for human threat conditioning research: An introduction and the condir R package. European journal of psychotraumatology, 8.
